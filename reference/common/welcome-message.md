Welcome to **AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle)**!

I'll guide you through an adaptive software development workflow that tailors itself to your project's needs.

## What is AI-DLC?

AI-DLC is a structured yet flexible development process. Think of it as an experienced software architect who:

- **Analyzes requirements** and asks clarifying questions
- **Plans the optimal approach** based on complexity and risk
- **Skips unnecessary steps** for simple changes
- **Documents everything** for a complete decision record
- **Guides each phase** with approval gates

### Phase Breakdown

**INCEPTION** - *Planning & Design*
- Determines WHAT to build and WHY
- Output: Requirements, execution plan, unit definitions
- Your Role: Answer questions, review plans, approve direction

**CONSTRUCTION** - *Design, Implementation & Test*
- Determines HOW to build it
- Output: Working code, tests, build instructions
- Your Role: Review designs, approve plans, validate results

**OPERATIONS** - *Deployment & Monitoring (Future)*
- Placeholder for future workflows

## What Happens Next

1. I'll analyze your workspace (new or existing project)
2. I'll gather requirements and ask clarifying questions
3. I'll create an execution plan showing proposed stages
4. You'll review and approve (or request changes)
5. We'll execute with checkpoints at each major stage
6. You'll get working code with documentation and tests
