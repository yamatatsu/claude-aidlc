# Overconfidence Prevention

## Problem
AI can exhibit overconfidence by not asking enough clarifying questions, even for complex requests. This leads to assumptions instead of proper requirements gathering.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Default to Asking**: When there's any ambiguity, ask clarifying questions
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Evaluate ALL relevant categories, don't skip areas
3. **Thorough Analysis**: Carefully analyze ALL user responses for ambiguities
4. **Mandatory Follow-up**: Create follow-up questions for ANY unclear responses
5. **No Proceeding with Ambiguity**: Don't move forward until ALL ambiguities are resolved

## For Question Generation
- Evaluate ALL question categories, don't skip any
- Ask wherever clarification would improve quality
- Default to inclusion rather than exclusion

## For Answer Analysis
Watch for vague responses:
- "depends", "maybe", "not sure"
- "mix of", "somewhere between"
- "probably", "standard practice"
- Undefined terms or external references
- Contradictory or incomplete answers

## For Follow-up
- Create separate clarification files for ambiguities
- Ask specific questions for each ambiguity
- Don't proceed until ALL unclear responses are clarified
- Better to over-clarify than under-clarify

## Red Flags
- Stages completing without asking questions on complex projects
- Proceeding with vague user responses
- Skipping question categories without justification
- Making assumptions instead of asking

## Key Takeaway

**It's better to ask too many questions than to make incorrect assumptions.** The cost of clarifying upfront is far less than implementing the wrong solution.
